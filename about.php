	<p>
		Identifying which method would be (the most) appropriate in a given context to evaluate a collaborative system can be a challenge due to a number of factors,
		such as finding the existing methods in the literature, as well as information about their application. This challenge motivated the development of StoreAnt - a
		tool that offers a repository in which information about collaborative evaluation methods can be stored, supporting researchers and practitioners in finding and
		comparing existing methods. In other words, it supports curation of collaborative evaluation methods.
